# DotNet 6 Features Notes 
 
- Status of the startup.cs file(it is gone!)
- Top Level Statements are now set by default.
- WebApplication and WebApplicationBuilder
- Application Ports are now different for each application instead of 5000 and 5001.


* The README.md file will be updated as notes are added. :)
